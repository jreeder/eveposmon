        <description>The Amarr have always been fond of majestic and intimidating constructions. Their Control Towers do not deviate from that tradition and are truly big and powerful structures, intended more for preservation of territorial interests than commercial benefits.

        <description>Gallente Control Towers are more pleasing to the eye than they are strong or powerful. They have above average electronic countermeasures, average CPU output, and decent power output compared to towers from the other races, but are quite lacking in sophisticated defenses.

        <description>The Matari aren't really that high-tech, preferring speed rather then firepower or involved technology. Unfortunately that doesn't apply very well to stationary objects, much to the liking of the Amarr Empire.  

Amarrians call it a scrapheap of epic proportions. But don't underestimate these structures. Minmatar commanders usually have the last laugh when it comes to combat.
